# Multiple-Linear-Regression
It uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression. In regression with multiple independent variables, the coefficient denotes how much the dependent variable is expected to increase when any particular independent variable increases by one, holding all the other independent variables constant.
